# TagAI Contract V2

Smart contracts for **TagAI (TipTag)** on BSC — **Pump Version 9 (V9)**. V9 ties together **community token launches**, **creator IPShare**, **Nutbox community incentives**, and **PancakeSwap V4 on-chain trading**. Users participate through Twitter/X social activity; tokens start on a bonding curve and migrate to the DEX once listing conditions are met, with swap fees flowing back to the community and creators.

> **Earlier Pump versions (V1–V8)** live in the legacy Hardhat repo: [tagai-dao/tagai-contract](https://github.com/tagai-dao/tagai-contract). This repository is the Foundry-based **V9** deployment and supersedes V8 on BSC mainnet for new community tokens.

## What It Solves

- **Creators**: Launch community tokens, bind IPShare, and earn ongoing value from trading and social activity
- **Community members**: Hold community tokens, curate and stake, and share in community growth
- **Protocol**: Collect swap fees on PCS V4 and distribute them to the platform, IPShare subjects, and Nutbox reward pools

## End-to-End Flow

```
User creates community token
       │
       ▼
   Pump ──► Token (bonding curve trading)
       │            │
       │            ▼ listing threshold met
       │      PancakeSwap V4 concentrated liquidity pool
       │            │
       ▼            ▼
 Nutbox Community   TagAISwapHook
(reward calculation)  (swap fees + Nutbox injection)
```

1. Users create a community token via **Pump**, which also spins up a Nutbox **Community** and default reward pools
2. The **Token** trades on the bonding curve; price follows the supply curve
3. Once listing conditions are met, liquidity migrates to **PCS V4** and trading moves on-chain via the DEX
4. **TagAISwapHook** is attached to the V4 pool: it collects swap fees, routes them by rule, and can inject community tokens into Nutbox on large buys

## Core Contracts

| Contract | Role |
|----------|------|
| **Pump** | Community token factory: creation fees, Nutbox wiring, listing trigger |
| **Token** | Per-community ERC20: curve trading → listing → V4 liquidity |
| **IPShare** | Creator shares: buy/sell/stake with value capture (V2 reuses the live v1 deployment) |
| **TagAISwapHook** | PCS V4 hook: before/after swap callbacks, platform fee, IPShare share, Nutbox injection |
| **HourlyTickCalculator** | Nutbox reward calculator; distributes community tokens on hourly ticks |
| **SocialCurationFactory** | Social curation reward pool (Nutbox dApp) |
| **DFXStarScoreStakingFactory** | Score-staking reward pool (Nutbox dApp, e.g. DFXStar Score) |

### Nutbox Stack

Nutbox handles **Community creation, multi-pool reward ratios, Committee governance, and contract whitelisting**. When Pump creates a token, it also creates a Community and mounts a default SocialCuration pool. The Community admin can later add pools such as DFXStar Score Staking and adjust reward splits.

### Token Supply (1B per community)

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Bonding curve | 650M | Pre-listing curve trading |
| Listing liquidity | 200M | LP migrated to PCS V4 |
| Social / Nutbox | 150M | Community rewards (including Hook injection, etc.) |

### Key Mechanisms (summary)

- **Anti-snipe**: Elevated sell fees right after creation that decay quickly, discouraging sniping
- **Listing**: Once enough ETH accumulates on the curve, the Token initializes a V4 pool with bounded-range liquidity
- **Hook bitmap**: Hook address lower 16 bits must satisfy PCS V4 requirements (`0x0CC1`); deployed via CREATE2 salt mining
- **IPShare fee share**: Hook can route part of swap fees to a chosen IPShare subject (creator by default)
- **Nutbox injection**: On large buys, Hook injects a small fraction (0.2%) of purchased tokens into Nutbox’s distributable balance

## Protocol Versions

TagAI’s on-chain launch stack has evolved through multiple **Pump** factory versions on BSC. **IPShare v1** (`0x95450AaD4Cc195e03BB4791B7f6f04aC6D9BA922`) has been reused since early versions and is still shared by V9.

| Version | Repository | Status | Summary |
|---------|------------|--------|---------|
| **V1–V7** | [tagai-dao/tagai-contract](https://github.com/tagai-dao/tagai-contract) | Legacy | Iterative Hardhat releases: bonding-curve launch, IPShare value capture, PCS hook fee routing. Historical Pump / Hook addresses documented in that repo. |
| **V8** | [tagai-dao/tagai-contract](https://github.com/tagai-dao/tagai-contract) | Legacy (superseded) | Agent-focused communities: only agents could trade on the bonding curve pre-listing; 15% supply auto-provisioned for Nutbox Community creation with a default SocialCuration pool. |
| **V9** | **This repo** | **Current** | Full Nutbox integration (HourlyTickCalculator, SocialCuration, DFXStar Score Staking), open bonding-curve trading with anti-snipe, PCS V4 listing via `TagAISwapHook`, and Nutbox token injection on DEX swaps. |

### Legacy mainnet addresses (V1–V8)

Published in [tagai-contract README](https://github.com/tagai-dao/tagai-contract#contract-addresses-bsc-mainnet):

| Label | Address |
|-------|---------|
| IPShare (shared) | `0x95450AaD4Cc195e03BB4791B7f6f04aC6D9BA922` |
| Pump (early BSC) | `0x3E75E2db40E7cc9C7d7869Fc2d97eDAb01724212` |
| Token implementation (early BSC) | `0x679a06AB0970CA68007777b5460bDca240B59cD2` |
| TipTagSwapHook (early BSC) | `0xF815dB0fbeafED4C719F65E41dEC9C50fb357896` |
| **Pump V8** | `0x88d495228E831b01D8Ae6d62f9633cBcC6d27De2` |
| **TipTagSwapHook V8** | `0xF1fa1B3Eb87D9A916fc8d9D1b172Ec67b4612800` |

Existing tokens created under V8 (or earlier) remain bound to their original Pump / Token / Hook contracts. **New launches should use Pump V9** (addresses below).

### What changed in V9

- **Broader Nutbox stack**: HourlyTickCalculator plus DFXStar Score Staking factory alongside SocialCuration
- **Open curve trading**: No longer restricted to agent-only buys on the bonding curve (V8 constraint removed)
- **New Pump + Hook deployment**: Fresh factory and `TagAISwapHook` with updated listing and fee/injection logic on PCS V4
- **Same IPShare layer**: Creator shares still flow through the production IPShare v1 contract
